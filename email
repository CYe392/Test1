Hi,

I bought this UPPAbaby 2017 G-LUXE Stroller a few days ago, it turns out to be a used item! Rusty screws, horrible smell on the cushion, stains on the surfaces… My wife contacted you a week ago but all feedback she get is to return the item and we have to pay the shipping fee. Are you kidding me??? If it’s not a defected or used item I’m happy to pay the shipping, but this is a used item!!! It’s stated as a new one on your website, and I Emailed you last week and got confirmed it’s supposed to be new item! 

Wait for your response.
Chen
