Hi Katty,

It's nice talking to you over the phone. I just discussed with my wife and could we schedule a tour for June 4th? It would be my 15 months old daughter and my wife coming together with me.
Please let me know if there is a dress code and paper work requirement for the tour. Also, if we'd like to put my daughter on the waiting list, do we need to bring cash/check on that day?


Thanks,
Chenlin Ye
