Title	Add Milestone to Account Tracking on Iris

Problem Definition	Kayne Young   (6/21/2018 12:43 PM): 
Per Nicole Keyser, CAC TL, the current tracking of Transfers being submitted is very manual and prone to error.  Today, CAC TLs have to track work in arrears through the use of SOTs when it shows "Missing Transfer Initiated" after Docs Recieved. All the CACs have to account to which works was completed and which was missed, causing a lot of review and unnecessary rework.
Adding a "Transfer Submitted" milestone to the account tracking feature would plug this gap in the process, prevent a lot of post process audit by the TLs.
End State	No existing entries.

Under review for inclusion in Oct 2018 release.  Data availability is still under review.
Justin Harp   (8/2/2018 3:52 PM): 
Confirmed with Pressler Transfers Submitted is needed even though Transfers Initiated already exists.  They're two distinct steps in the process.
Kayne Young   (6/21/2018 12:43 PM):

Spoke with Tina - this email is not needed by IC TLs any longer.  ICs were removed some time ago and IC TLs have no actionable items.  Per Tina, Jessica Smith interviewed IC TLs and no one needed the email.
This item is being considered for Oct 2018 Iris Release

Drew:
Following ideas do not require any dev. work. 
Please ensure there are no downstream or reporting impacts, especially for 7815 and 7748.

7860: ~Finance Billing no longer needs to be included on Client death emails.                    (System parameter changes)
7785: FII would like to change the ordering of countries on the Countries entity so that UK appears second after the US. (bulk edit)
7815: Add three activity topics to Iris                                                                                    (new records for topic and topic collection)
7748: Add Account-level extension attribute: RJIS Fee Schedule (If links are not needed, no dev. work is required. New records for extension attribute, security resources, security resource roles etc.)   


Data migration tasks are required for the following:
7815,7748 and 
7759: Add office locations of CAC and IC to New Client Assignment Email template (update to email Template: fi_relationshipmanagement Assigned To is Updated)
7564: Notify on the “Follow-up on Transfer” activity topics are entered (added new shell email activity)
Data migration tool will need to be run to promote the data rows (new/updates to existing records such as system parameters, email templates) across STAGE-> QA->PPROD.
Please work with Chenlin on having the data migration files created for this and track this as a dependency for deployment.
We need to ensure that we are able to get these data records migrated to STAGE first.

For  7759, the GAL extract job needs to be updated. I’ve spoken with Venu on this. Please track this as a dependency to ensure that the “State” field is populated for system user records.


Plugin changes for the TimeBased Security related change requested by Marc
Configuration update to Fisher.Crm.MScrm.Plugins.TimeBaseSecurityAccess plugin
Register a new POST image for "Postop-contact-update-time base securityaccess" for "fi_salesuserid" attribute

Assign to Chenlin
7817: “Transfers Initiated” date field  : 
- New attribute to be added/ Audit log entity needs to be updated with new attribute, this will likely need SPROC change as well for the audit logs grid. 
- Please clarify whether there is a historic back  fill needed for this field
7862: IC TLs are receiving unnecessary email regarding Accounts Moved to Inactive CSA  
-          Code change needed for this due to how the internal contact list is being created and reused across emails in the plugin code. 



Chenlin: Refer to the above for your tasks for the IRIS release and let me know if there are questions. We need to discuss 7862 and how best to accommodate for this change.


Please track all of these items for the release to ensure we are on track from a dependency standpoint
