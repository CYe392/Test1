Interview

I was contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, who later called me and informally discussed the position they were looking for and asked about my background. After this phone call, the recruiter scheduled an hour-long technical phone interview with two software engineers based on my availability, which happened to be 2 weeks after this initial phone call from the recruiter.
The technical phone screen was conducted using collabedit. First, the interviewer…

Given two (dictionary) words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it with another letter while the ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.

Example:
Given "foo", "app"; returns true
   we can map 'f' -&gt; 'a' and 'o' -&gt; 'p'
Given "bar", "foo"; returns false
   we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o'

Given "turtle", "tletur"; returns true
   we can map 't' -&gt; 't', 'u' -&gt; 'l', 'r' -&gt; 'e', 'l' -&gt; 'u', 'e' -'r'

Given "ab", "ca"; returns true
   we can map 'a' -&gt; 'c', 'b'

Interview

Hiring process included a telephonic call, and onsite interview with 10 folks. two folks were assigned for every interview (that is 5 interviews). They were piloting an initiative of a junior developer paired with a senior developer, and finally with hiring manager. The recruiter didnot get back, but upon calling multiple times, I got a response saying negative.

I was contacted by a recruiter through email and set up a phone interview. The technical portion was done through collabedit. They asked two coding problems. They also asked to describe a project I had worked on before. I had a second phone interview that was similar to the first. The interviewer was hard to understand. Again had two coding problems, both were fair.

Interview

The recruiter contacted me through email and arranged me a technical phone interview. I'm a little disappointed though, the interview was scheduled at 6:00PM Eastern Time.
During the phone interview(using collabedit.com), the interviewer asked two coding questions:
(1) the deepest common ancestor of two nodes of a tree
(2) all permutations of a string.
The questions were reasonable, but I failed to solve the second one. Also the interviewer thought I'm not engaging enough(didn't talk much).

Interview

Was contacted by a recruiter through LinkedIn (very meta) and given two weeks preparation. The interviewer I was scheduled with wasn't the one who ended up interviewing me, and instead it was someone who had a very tough time speaking English and explaining the problems. I solved both questions, but it took a long time before I would understand what he meant when trying to explain them. This chewed up a substantial chunk of the interview time (for example, it took ~5-10 minutes to even get to the collaborative online editor because I couldn't understand the letters he was pronouncing in the URL).

Write a program that takes an integer and prints out all ways to multiply smaller integers that equal the original number, without repeating sets of factors. In other words, if your output contains 4 * 3, you should not print out 3 * 4 again as that would be a repeating set. Note that this is not asking for prime factorization only. Also, you can assume that the input integers are reasonable in size; correctness is more important than efficiency.

if your code is good enough, the time complexity should be n!
but when i was interviewing with the two interviewers, i wrote a n^n solution.
actually, there are recursive and iterative solutions in n! time complexity.

I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA).

Interview

First had a call with the recruiter who scoped my background and interests and decided for which stream within software engineering was he going to put my application in for. Since I'm more of an interactive, client-side guy, I chose Software engg - Frontend.
Had an hour long phone interview with a frontend engineer , who started with general CS and systems questions, went deep into JAVA (Threads, deadlocks, VM, garbage collections) and ended with some challenging javascript questions, which neede knowledge of javascript patterns.
About a week later, got a call saying I had made it and they were flying me out to Mountain view for the on-site rounds, 'INvitational'. Chose a convenient date.
On their campus, got to know that linkedin holds 'INvitational' for entry-level candidates. It's basically one whole day of interviews and events with their selected set of candidates. The day started off with breakfast, ice-brekers for all the interviewees and an inspirational talk by a senior manager. After warming up, two hour long interviews were scheduled. Both with experienced engineers. One was algorihms - with concept only from standard books like CTCI and the second was web-module development test, where I was shown a certain part of their site and had to write the structure, style it and code the logic. The main thing is to talk through your approach.
After the first two rounds was a long tour of campus, lunch and talk with recently joined engineers about their experience. Spent 2 hours here, but helped calm me down.
The final 2 rounds came after, one was with a very experienced engineer, who showed me a new UI feature he was implemeting on his work laptop and I had to try and code that up. Stumbled a lot here, mainly because I didn't know about how to implement each feature for all browsers/devices. The last round was a manager interview in which I had to talk about a system design (CTCI - esque) and later about my work experience and work style, probably to determine a culture fit.
The day ended by all of us candidates and a few recruters going to a nice sushi place with tons of options. Linkedin surely keeps you well fed.

He had no better thing to do so he asked me trace the whole recursive code on phone. I don't know how these people judge someone's skills..

Got contacted by a recruiter via linkedin. Did an initial phone interview on ml concepts and coding and according to the recruiter it went so well that they did not need me to do another one.
Got invited to the campus for an onsite which I can name more a torture than an interview; staring from about 9:30 am lasting until 5pm. 7 interviews in a day!!!!! Unstructured interview; I was doing the interview for a data science/software engineering position; open ended questions; some interviewers were more after math/theory and some high level software design and some not sure! It was hard to figure who is looking for what and how to form a proper answer. One of the interviewers was a little rude even though he was 15-20 mins late for the interview. Generally not a good experience. The campus and food were great though.
Got a call from recruiter a few days later. "Your interview went well but we couldn't find any position for you. I tried to find a team by passing your resume over but unfortunately we don't have an open position at the time"! A simple question for them: Why the hell do you interview people then? Why the hell do you waste people's times by sending bunch of bol... job opening messages over and over? Interesting that after I did the onsite and was waiting for the feedback, there was another linkedIn recruiter contacting me about open engineering position at linkedin!!!!

1st call - Phone call with the Recruiter just to talk about what you've done and what currently interests you. Basically to directly communicate with you to see if you'd be a good fit for the company to want to go through the interview process with you
2nd call - Technical phone interview #1 using Collabedit. Given two questions to solve in one hour. First question was to find the lowest common ancestor given two nodes and the second question was to determine if two strings are isomorphic (there exact question can be found on this site)
3rd call - Technical phone interview #2 also using Collabedit. Given two questions to solve in one hour as well. First question was find the largest subsequence given an array that yields the largest sum. The second question was a modification of the first that required me to find the largest subsequence of the given array that yields the largest PRODUCT. Didn't complete the code for the second question in time.

The recruiter didn't have much details to share with me and he told me that there is nothing serious, but, this is how it works, for me; I didn't know the criteria they judged about.

I applied through other source. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in December 2012.

Interview

I was contacted by a LinkedIn HR rep a few weeks after submitting my resume at a conference. He was really enthusiastic and clearly loves his job, which initially peaked my interested in working for LinkedIn.
I had one phone interview, which was pleasant and went well. About a week later I was invited to attend a Linkedin Invitational, which I gather is LinkedIn's new approach to the gruelling, all day long interview process. Basically, I arrived at the LinkedIn office, along with about fifteen other Software Engineering candidates (all new grads, like me), to participate in an all day long event which included not only four hour-long, one on one interviews (three technical, one management), but also included Q&A sessions with a group of recent hires, the director of Engineering and the CEO himself, as well as a campus tour, and a fancy dinner in San Francisco. LinkedIn put us up in a great hotel in downtown San Francisco that night, and I gladly took the opportunity to spend the rest of the night on the town with the other candidates (it was a Friday after all).
Overall, the experience was overwhelmingly positive. How could I not want to work for LinkedIn after that? Especially after talking to so many current LinkedIn employees who clearly loved their jobs and were genuinely excited to talk to us candidates. If a company cares so much about treating not just their employees well, but even their candidates well, I think it bodes well for a future career with them.
Anyways, a week later I was contacted by my HR rep again, this time to offer me a job with a very good salary and hefty relocation bonus, as well stock options, great benefits, free CalTrain pass, etc. It took all of about two seconds to decide I was going to take the job.

Application

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1+ week. I interviewed at LinkedIn.

Interview

Recruiter was awesome and had great communication. Did a phone screen with her and then moved on to two technical phone interviews. Both phone interviews are done in an IDE of your choice with someone watching your screen over skype. You're given 45 minutes to complete the problem and then allowed to wrap it up at home and submit it.
Passed the first telephone screening but "failed" the second. When I asked why I failed, the recruiter sent me the engineer's responds with all of these problems with my code.
Granted these problems were present in my first 45 minutes (because I was working through the problem) but my final solution had none of these problems.
It was evident that the 2nd interviewer didn't even look at my final solution. He made his judgement off of what he saw on the phone an told me to submit a final answer anyways.

Average Interview
Application

I applied through an employee referral. The process took 3 days. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in May 2013.

Interview

I skipped the phone interview since I had an employee's referral and went straight for the technical onsite interviews. There were five 1-hour long back-to-back technical rounds. The first round was a general design round with the hiring manager. He asked me some high level architecture questions, how to implement a REST API, etc. which were pretty basic. After that there were 3 coding interviews with a panel of 2 engineers in each round.
My problem was that after giving you the initial question the interviewers gave me no time to think. Every time you pause to think your general solution or if you try coming up with a better approach they keep asking you more questions. Two of those interviews seemed to be interviewing the first time and almost seemed to have an agenda to put me down so he/she could look good to someone else. The questions weren't hard at all and in fact I ended up giving optimized solutions O(n) instead of standard brute-force solutions O(n^2). I felt like two of the six engineers themselves didn't quite understand why the solutions were better and ultimately although I nailed 2 of the 3 interviews I ended up not getting an offer. I guess I feel let down by the interview process cause although I took some more time, I ended up arriving at optimal solutions on 2 of the 3 coding challenges. I could have just gone for the simple, boring and brute-force solution but instead I tried to do better and they didn't seem to care or notice.
The last round was on design and architecture by a senior engineer and I really enjoyed that interview. It was open ended and challenging enough and the interviewer seemed to know what he was doing as we dug deeper and deeper into the details.

Code a non blocking thread safe queue
and
code a text justification routine (Given a line length insert white space so text is uniformly displayed within the given length).

Both are fairly straightforward, but I had spent time on the first portion.

Interview

Get contacted by recruiter and set up a phone interview. There're 2 interviewer at the same time, one senior engineer and one engineer who's just 4 months out of college. Questions are very easy. But I've already had two other interviews that day and gets pretty tired. And the younger engineer was keep pushing me and talking all the time when I was coding and show how knowledgeable he is. He interrupts me all the time, even when I call a helper function which I plan to implement later. I can't think under this situation and skewed up the interview.
One week later the recruiter called me to inform me about the rejection, when I'm in a lecture.

Overall experience was average.
Post lunch interviewers were less experienced I'm assuming, because one of them yawned non-stop and a couple others had taken a vow not to speak during the interviews.

Interview was an initial phone conversation followed by an onsite interview day. I was interviewed by 5 different people. They flew me out and put me up in a hotel. The interview process was pretty standard. It consisted of a technical coding interview where I had to write code on the white board, followed by a software design interview and then some interviews with the management. I also was given a tour of the campus and given a welcome to your interview pack. Hardest part of the interview was at the end with one of the executives, who tore apart my resume, questioned what I was wearing, swore and made me feel like a fraud!

Interview

Phone interview, followed by another phone interview, which was exactly the same, just different questions, followed by nothing...
Yes, that's right. On the first interview, I solved the given problem. Then they scheduled another phone interview. It went well, however, I found the interviewers to be really unprofessional, kind of rude. The whole process felt like I was talking to machines reading a script. Really, no human factor in the whole process. At this point I knew I did not want to work for this company.
I wrote the recruiter an email expressing my disappointment. He replied saying he will take a look and give me back feedback.
I never heard again. I accepted another offer, but out of curiosity, and for the purpose of this review, I decided to call the recruiter 10 days later.
The guy told me he left LinkedIn for another opportunity, and that he also really disliked how things were done there. We ended up laughing about it together, and congratulating each other on our new gigs outside of LinkedIn!!
My recommendation is the following. I would never work for a company that treats applicants like an assembly line. Know that they are lucky you decided to apply, and they should know that too. They should make you feel comfortable on the phone, and motivate you to solve the problem, not just throw you a question and sit back, read a script.

Interview

Had an initial call with a recruiter followed by two phone screens and 4 onsite interviews as part of LinkedIn Invitational. Recruiting did a great job showing us around, and a few of the engineers made a really strong impression on me. However for the most part I found the interviewers to be cold, deliberately vague, and frustrating. In one case, the interviewer would frantically grab his notepad and start scribbling furiously every time I made a mistake. It was that obvious. Compared to my interviews at Google (received an offer), although the process at both places was largely robotic technical interviewing, I felt LinkedIn interviewers were much more difficult to connect with.

I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA).

Interview

I was referred by a friend, and then contacted by an internal recruiter. I chatted with him for a while, and a phone interview was scheduled.
The phone interview was fairly standard. I had told the recruiter that I was most comfortable interviewing in Python, or C++ in a pinch. This apparently didn't get passed along to the interviewer, who asked me to code some stuff in Java. I was also asked about my experience, although it almost seemed like he was waiting for me to say the right magic word in the answer than actually listening about what I'd done.
I was told by the recruiter that they'd like me to do more interviews, and that those would be coordinated by a different recruiter. For the next 3 weeks, this recruiter kept telling me he'd be in touch "soon". That never happened, despite me repeatedly reminding him. Then he disappeared on vacation for the holidays. I don't know if he was being lazy, or what. I still haven't been contacted, or told that I'm no longer being considered, so who knows.

The recruiter was efficient in setting up phone interview and on-site interview. Phone interview consisted of Java questions: basic, object reference, singleton pattern. On-site interview: linked list questions, recursion, multi-threading, and unit testing in terms of Test-driven programming (This is where I stripped). They're big on Agile I think. The main thing is you were not only required to solve the problems but also solved it the way they wanted/suggested.

The questions are not as hard as Google/Facebook and sit in the same level as Amazon/Microsoft. The people are generally nice except two interviewers looking and laughing at funny pictures during interview. I am confident with my performance on all the other rounds except the one with two unprofessional interviewers, they interrupt me multiple times and always persuade me to adopt their "best" solution.

Application

I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in October 2012.

Interview

LinkedIn fast-tracked my interview process, but they managed to set up a series of interviews with the wrong people (their applications team, rather than the data team). Each interviewer separately came to the conclusion in the course of the interview that I should have been interviewing with the other team.
There were five interviews throughout the day, all an hour each, all but one of which consisted of two interviewers each (a junior interviewer, who was "in training" as an interviewer, and a senior interviewer). Each interview had a different purpose: there was an interview with a manager to see about team fit, a "big-picture" design / software architecture interview, two coding interviews etc. I had just recently interviewed with Google, and was surprised to find that the technical competence of interviewers at LinkedIn was significantly lower than that of interviewers at Google. (This might have just been the people assigned to interview me, I don't know.) It was clear that at least half the interviewers who were asking technical questions came completely unprepared to understand some of the theoretical issues behind the questions -- one interviewer argued for 10 minutes with me about the properties of minimal spanning trees, which she clearly did not understand. When right off the bat I outlined the algorithm with optimal complexity, she spent 10 minutes debating with me whether the solution would even work, and her questions made it really clear that she didn't have basic intuition of graph theory, or understand how or why Prim's algorithm worked. She wasn't satisfied until I described a much more straightforward but less efficient algorithm. She also spent a couple of minutes going back and forth with her co-interviewer when they came in, while looking at a laptop screen trying to decide which question on a company-internal list of questions they should ask me: they hadn't even picked a question, much less thought through it. (A later interview, when they tacked on interviews with a couple of people in the data team, was in fact very technically challenging, and required a good understanding of Bayesian networks, which I didn't brush up on before the interview and therefore bombed.)
I will say that overall the interview process at LinkedIn was much better structured and better organized than the process at Google. Also, repeatedly I heard from LinkedIn employees that the thing they liked about working there was that it was still a small, nimble company, meaning they could innovate fast, they owned their work, and they had access to pretty much anyone in the company. However, personally Google feels like a better cultural fit for me than LinkedIn.
It took LinkedIn forever to get back to me with an answer (3 weeks?), in spite of the fact I had a major visa issue and had made it clear multiple times that I needed an answer quickly.

Reasons for Declining

Cultural fit, less apparent technical competence than Google (at least speaking of some of my interviewers, I'm sure they have some great people there), lower salary offer than Google (even though they allocated greater equity), and the fact it took them forever to get back to me in spite of my request for a quick turnaround on the hiring decision.

I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in June 2012.

Interview

In order to honor the NDA I signed, I'll try to be as vague as I can about the specific technical questions. Had a phone screen first. The phone screen consisted of two programming questions. The first one was very simple. It was a question just to make sure basically you can program and design unit tests for it. It was easy to get bugs in it, but as long as you know how to program, you should be fine. The second one tested your data structures. Make sure you know what lists and sets are good for.
The recruiter was very responsive. I got a response within the next three days. He offered me good luck and transferred me to another recruiter to schedule the on-site. I had to change the on-site date once and the recruiter was very professional and accommodating.
The on-site was extremely nice. To be honest, I wasn't particularly interested in LinkedIn at first, but the first phone interviews, recruiters, and campus really impressed me. Their campus is right next to Google's. Once you go in, they give you an ipad 2 for the day, where you can check your schedule and interviewers. It consisted of 5 interviews along with lunch: 2 technical, 1 design, 1 explain one of your projects in more detail than anyone would ever care, and 1 behavioral. The 2 technical interviews were fairly straight forward. First one was really straightforward in fact. It was just a very long programming question, but it was overall pretty straight forward and did not involve any special algorithms or data structures. The second one was a bit more tricky. All I can say is get very familiar with binary trees. I know for sure I got at least the first part very well. Second part, I spent a lot more time than I should have on it. The part I felt I really bombed was the design questions. The design question is actually posted on glassdoor by another candidate (hint hint), but I won't say it in order to honor the NDA, but definitely study the questions the other people have provided here. In any case, this interviewer impressed me most with his knowledge and he just seemed really smart in general. I'm sure this was the interview I got rejected on though. Definitely know your distributed systems. I was unfortunate in the fact that I never had any experience with distributed systems. I must also mention though, the last interview for the day was probably one of the worst interviews I have ever had. Not in terms of me not doing well, but the interviewers were pretty junior and seemed very nervous. It felt very awkward since one of them was studying something, and not paying attention at all, and the other was continually checking his time, obviously hoping it would be over soon. They drilled me in one of my projects into more details, which I kept giving, but it felt very uncomfortable since there were many instances when it felt like they did not know what to say so there were pockets of silence.
Over all though, the experience was great. I did not get an offer, which I was a little disappointed with since I thought I did decently overall, but I did not do well on the design question and ultimately, it's their call on who they are looking for.

Interview

I am not on the job market. Yet an internal recruiter contacted me via linkedin. I decided to do a quick tech with them to feel them out. They knew I have many years experience, so they arranged a senior person to conduct my interview.
However, the question was extremely basic. So I was immediately turned off... I am fairly sure he had no idea of my background nor even looked at my resume.
I did not even code the basic edge cases of handling null or empty input, because the interviewer kept interrupting me... Let me explain.
I was logged into work on my normal machine, and so I had to use an auxiliary computer to do the tech interview... but that computer monitor is like 3 feet away from it's keyboard.. so i would type the line, then squint to look at it.. and before i could correct a typo, the interviewer would condescendingly indicate the line needed a correction.

Interview Questions

Create an isNumber(string) function. Handle signed / unsigned, floating point, any number of digits, etc. Probably commas, and currency signs, or whatever. It was open ended and governed by whatever unit tests he wanted you to make it work against.

That was seriously, the only question they asked me; someone with software development experience since 1994. I was expecting graph theory.. tree traversal.. design patterns.. more relevant topics... and instead asked a question i solved 23 years ago in a basic C programming college course.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took a week. I interviewed at LinkedIn in June 2015.

Interview

Recruiter contacted me. Set up a phone interview.
I was informed there will be two interviewers on the phone, but only one of them turned up, not sure if other guy was on mute since he was new to LinkedIn per his linkedIn profile.
The interviewer's body language revealed a lot about him. He was trying to be nice, but that wasn't really true. Asked me about skill set and then moved to technical part. First 35-40 minutes was about c++ questions and multi-threading. Then last 20 minutes or so was coding question. Overall the interview lasted for 1 hour. I took about 5-10 minutes to understand the question, primarily because there was about 30 lines of code pasted in collabedit already. When I tried to ask a question to clarify, I was told there is nothing to ask, everything is on collabedit. I guess I will let you guess his attitude. I explained him my pseudocode before coding and he seemed to be happy with it. I almost was done with the solution by end of 1 hour, but I guess that does not count. He did not give me a chance to ask my questions.
To summarize, a lot of reviews on glassdoor says they repeat the questions. That was not the case with me, so please be prepared completely. Just don't depend completely on glassdoor. Go to leetcode, hackerrank, geeksforgeeks and careercup. As for books, cracking the coding interviews is awesome!
Its not even one day yet, so I haven't heard back from recruiter, but I am not expecting a good result.

Interview Questions

1. What is a mutex, semaphore
2. What is virtual memory, paging. Why is it required to swap pages, etc..
3. What is virtual destructor (explain with some code).
4. The code was pasted in collabedit. Its an easy problem to solve, but only if you understand the problem in 5 minutes. I had about 20 minutes in total. (You might see the interviewer has mixed Java and C++. There is no public/private access specifier. Integer class is only in Java, coding standards are according to Java specifications, but I guess you get the point of the question, so that's not a problem).

/**
 * Given a nested list of integers, returns the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth

Recruiter reached out to me and set me up for an interview. Emailed me prep material for the phone interview. I scheduled phone interview for a month later date.
there were 2 engineers on the phone call. Their introductions were short and I kept mine short enough to get more time for the coding problem. They used collabedit for reviewing/sharing code.
There was only one coding question followed by wrap up time so I can ask them questions.
Entire interview lasted 1 hour. They asked me to explain my solution and it's space/time complexities. Asked me how I can improve it. (99% of the time the answer to improve time complexity is to compromise on space complexity. That means introduce a freaking hashmap in your solution).
Overall decent experience.

Interview Questions

Given two words as Strings, determine if they are isomorphic. Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all occurrences of it with another letter while the ordering of the letters remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a letter may map to itself.

*
 * Example:
 * given "foo", "app"; returns true
 * we can map 'f' -&gt; 'a' and 'o' -&gt; 'p'
 *
 * given "foo", "boa"; returns false
 * we can map 'f' -&gt; 'b', 'o' -&gt; 'o', we can't map 'o' -&gt; 'a'
 *
 * given "bar", "foo"; returns false
 * we can't map both 'a' and 'r' to 'o'
 *
 * given "turtle", "tletur"; returns true
 * we can map 't' -&gt; 't', 'u' -&gt; 'l', 'r' -&gt; 'e', 'l' -&gt; 'u', 'e' -&gt;'r'
 *
 * given "ab", "ca"; returns true
 * we can map 'a' -&gt; 'c', 'b' -&gt; 'a'

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in April 2015.

Interview

I had my first phone interview with them. They seemed like nice poeple. But one of them was hired at linkedin a month before my interview and the other interviewer around 6 month before. I checked their background and they were almost new graduates from BS!! I have MS and couple of years of working experience. They asked me about my project and when I started talking about Weka algorithm and how I used it in my project, they were constantly asking what is WEKA?!! I was surprised that they didn't even know about that. Then they asked two questions. First was too simple, but they were trying to exaggerate it. I solved it with two different approaches. The second one was complicated but the issue was my internet connection got lost at the beginning of that and I couldn't resolve the connection issue so couldn't code it but provided the solution verbally and explained to them that I didn't at all expect internet connection issues. The interviewer said my verbal solution is correct. I was so mad at Comcast at that time, we switched to a faster service and it apparently became worst.
around 2 weeks later I got an Email from recruiter that I wasn't the best match! Seriously, they didn't even give me a second chance even though they knew it wasn't my fault. Anyway, overall being judged by a person who was hired a month ago at Linkedin right after collage, I didn't expect much more than this.

Interview

I was contacted by recruiter via LinkedIn. After chatting and getting a feel, a phone screen was set up. Interviewer went over my background before starting the interview. The questions were very easy. See questions below. Like most mentioned, the questions are on Glassdoor. They recycle through the same questions. To be honest, i don't know what LinkedIn wants. Even with the most optimal best solution all explained out step by step covering all edge cases, they still said no after the phone screen. It's another thing if you have a doubt about missing something. I even wonder why they waste some of our times if they are not genuinely interested.
The recruiter was great and fast about everything. I interviewed with LinkedIn a couple of years ago and ironically, it was the same story.
Personally, I have just decided to never interview at LinkedIn again. I guess i am just not LinkedIn material. Maybe that's a good thing :) On to the next, life is short....

Interview

Interviewer reached out on LinkedIn. I wasn't ready to move ahead with the process at that point of time. We followed up when I had a pending offer and decided to move ahead with the process.
There were 2 phone rounds which covered standard interviewing questions followed by an onsite round. The onsite round was a day of 5 interviews along with a lunch interview with one of the engineers.
Out of the 5 onsite rounds, 2 were meant to be coding rounds and 1 was meant to be a design round.
The remaining 2 rounds surprisingly were meant to be technical discussions about my work experience and more architecture.
The coding rounds were simpler than the phone interviews. The fact that the 2 technical interviews virtually covered the same architecture of my work experience was staggering in spite of me raising it with the second interviewer.
The engineers I met were well-mannered and polite. However, the process in general wasn't the most organized one.

Interview

Initially talked to HR. She asked which all companies I was interviewing with and few other common questions. Then got one technical phone interview through collabedit. Asked about Least common ancestor using parent pointer. They don't even care to reply if you are not selected. Even if you follow up they won't respond.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at LinkedIn in January 2015.

Interview

I was contacted by a LinkedIn recruiter a few months ago (by November, 2014 I think) about a position in Software Engineering area. After the first phone screen (non technical) I was scheduled my first technical phone interview, I decided to take 2 months to get ready and warming up in Algorithms and Data Structures. Finally I finish my first interview very disappointed (with my self) because the interview question was so easy that I could have wrote the solution in less than 15 minutes and I spent almost 45, thanks to my nerves. The interviewer was polite, well explained and called on time, I have no complains about that.

I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn.

Interview

The interview took about a month. Two rounds of telephone interviews, both of which are about coding. The first phone interview was ok but the second one was not so pleasant experience in that the interviewers did not seem to care about what my thinking process was. Though I described my thoughts they didn't seem to follow; there were once or twice I talked about an idea but they were not so open to really think of what I said, instead, they gave some hints that are not useful at all, even worse interrupted my thought.
I actually saw these problems before on careercup websites but didn't practice them. So was not able to come to the 'correct' solution (well I think that's what they want, because they were not really eager to interact) in 40 minutes.

I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at LinkedIn in December 2014.

Interview

The most professional and comfortable interviewing experience I've ever had.
I gave my resume to a LinkedIn engineer at my university career fair, and also applied online. A few weeks later, a recruiter called me and discussed what I was looking for in an internship. He then set up my first round technical interview: a single 1-hour phone interview, coding on collabedit. A few days after the first interview, my recruiter scheduled my second round technical interview: two 1-hour phone interviews, same format. The recruiter was very friendly and helpful in giving me advice and insight into the interviews. All three engineers I talked to were patient with me as I worked through the coding problems.
If I had to say anything negative about the experience, it would be the length (6 weeks between last interview and offer letter). However, the recruiter was quick to respond to my emails and was willing to take the time to explain exactly what was going on in the process.

Interview

A recruiter reached out to me a few months ago asking if I was interested in possibly pursuing an opportunity in working with LinkedIn.
Two phone screens after that, all technical and took place over a site like collabedit. The interviewers were nice, and the questions were not too hard; they get everything from a test bank.
Was invited for an on-site round after that. During the on-site round, you go through 6 interviews; two based on coding, one on technical communication, one on a project you worked on before, and one on design. Make sure you prepare for the coding section! You don't have freedom to answer the question in any way you wish; you have to go by the function headers they provide for you.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, CA) in January 2015.

Interview

HR contact me through linkedin, scheduled 2 phone interviews, pass both and move to the onsite interview, which consist of 6 back to back interviews, starting from 10am till 4pm. There are 3 technical interviews(coding skill, algorithm, system design) and 3 non-technical interviews(communication skills, lunch, and talk with the hiring manager)
Generally speaking all interview questions are not super hard and most of them are reasonable, the only thing that may affect your performance is that there's no time to rest, it's basically 6 hours back to back interview except the lunch. The lunch is lead by a senior enginner, we did a lot of chatting, which made me even more exhausted.
I'd suggest that if Linkedin can setup a 30min break time after lunch, that would help the candidates to relax and gain some stemina back because the 2 interviews after the lunch are both technical.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took a week. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in February 2015.

Interview

Interview process started by a recruiter contacting me on LinkedIn and scheduled a phone interview. The interview questions weren't hard, the interviewer was expecting the solution to be in certain fashion, when i am writing code and explaining him a different way I do it, he doesn't want to hear, kept interrupting me with his questions before I finish what I have to say, which is very annoying and I lost my interest in explaining it to him and I told him I will write the code and if it doesn't work we can discuss, looks like he wasn't interested in code until he understood the logic. So, all in all, it wasn't a great interview.
Coming to the LinkedIn's recruiting part. They suck, absolutely bad hiring process and communications. 3 years ago I interviewed for LinkedIn and I didn't get through their phone screen, once phone screen is done the recruiter never gets back to you with anything. I emailed him multiple times, no reply, I called him, no reply and after 5 weeks, he replies with "we are not interested and will not be moving forward". LinkedIn needs 5 weeks to get feedback for your phone screen sounds "reasonable time". This time I didn't bother to even ask the recruiter about feedback.
I personally decided not to interview with them anytime in future again.

I got this interview through a recruiter through LinkedIn website. It was a one hour phone interview. They asked about my work in the first 10 minutes. The interviewers were nice, they were on time and they described their role in the company. They didn't talk much during the interview. The recruiter replied by email after two days. After writing the code they asked me about test cases.

Interview Questions

They asked to write a function that takes a string and check if it is a number. The second question was given a sorted array that has been rotated, find a number in that array {6,7,1,2,3,4,5}

After that it was typical coding algorithm problems. some were harder than the other. If you took too much time solving one question and ended up not getting multiple questions it probably means you will not proceed to the next round. expect to solve two to three problems.

After that call the process is to interview on-site where you could have from 3 to 5 interviews.

Interview

Had one technical phone screen which was easy. Then was called onsite for a set of 5 rounds. It was a long day of interviews. The interviewer in the first algorithm round had a fixed solution in his head and could not accept any other solution and was always trying to force me to move towards how he thinks the problem should be solved rather than what I was doing, he had no interest in my solution and I know my solution was right because I had solved that problem before and had confirmed it with online solutions and new all the ways of doing it. The second algorithms round was a dynamic programming round and to my surprise one of the interviewers had no clue about DP and was constantly arguing with me and the other interviewer saying that my solution was wrong. However the first interviewer understood my solution and agreed with what I was doing and was trying to explain to the other interviewer that my approach was different but most optimal( I was doing a bottom up DP where as he only knew how to do Top down which is recursion with memoization). After 30 mins of explaining to the second interviewer, he still couldnt get what is bottom up DP. I was very disappointed with Linked in on this. They should send interviewers who know their stuff or atleast what they are asking..lol. The design round was not a typical design round, instead of having a discussion with what's right and wrong with my design, he just asked me a series of questions and got done with the interview, I felt as if he was just assessing my answers based on what he had in mind. The manager round was good and relaxed. The last round i.e technical communication doesnt make any sense as everything is already covered in the manager round. I guess I just had a bad day on my luck with weird interviewers

Interview

Linkedin is hiring like crazy right now - on the particular random day I arrived, there were at least 10 other applicants hanging around the receptionist's desk. They sent me a solicitation on linkedin (no surprise), and I followed up and had a technical phone screen quickly scheduled. They then flew me out to interview on-site about a week later and put me up in a really nice hotel. They gave me a gift bag on arrival, and the whole process felt really comfortable, which is unusual for an interview. I interviewed with something like 11 people total, some alone, and some in groups of 2. Half of those interviews were about demonstrating programming skills on a whiteboard, the other half were for demonstrating "design" skills (abstractly designing systems). There was a break in the middle for lunch in their giant, excellent cafeteria.

Interview Questions

You have a potentially very-large set of documents, which are potentially very-large, and contain text. For searching these documents, they've been pre-processed into a (very-large) table mapping words to the set of documents that contain each word. E.g.

(word) : (documents (referenced by ID) containing that word)
Apple: 1, 4, 5, 6, 32
Banana: 5, 6, 7, 9, 32
Cantaloupe: 1, 2, 6
...

Clients will pass in a set of words (e.g. {apple, cantaloupe}), and want the set of document IDs that contain all the words. (e.g. {apple, cantaloupe} -> {1, 6}) Design a distributed system to implement this, bearing in mind that the number of documents, the number of words, and the number of document-IDs-per-word are potentially really, really big.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in June 2015.

Interview

LinkedIn's interview process is very transparent. Before every interview, I was given the names and LinkedIn profiles of every person I would speak to. My recruiter also called me before each interview step to discuss the expectations and share a few preparation tips. Even if you don't end up working with them, you'll probably at least come away feeling much more knowledgeable and prepared for technical interviews in general!
I noticed two unusual aspects about LinkedIn's software engineer interviews:
(1) Most interviews are 2-on-1, with both interviewers submitting feedback.
(2) Their coding questions apparently come from a shared company-wide repository. All the coding questions I got were identical (verbatim) to ones that have already been posted here or on other sites. I didn't know this upfront, but I realized it when I looked them up after my interviews.
My interview process was:
Technical phone screen:
- 2 coding questions
On-site interview:
- 2 coding / algorithms
- 1 system design
- 1 technical communication
- 1 behavioral / cultural fit (host manager)
- 1 lunch interview (note: the lunch interviewer does submit feedback too)
The coding questions were all very easy. I would say they were of slightly below-average difficulty compared to many other major Silicon Valley tech companies. I got the impression that the LinkedIn folks pay much more attention to your communication skills and design thinking than your raw problem-solving ability.
The technical communication interview was fun. Basically I was asked to talk through one of my previous projects / systems, as if I were orienting a new developer on my team. It felt just like a real engineering discussion at work. Likewise, the host manager interview was really relaxed, focusing mostly on probing my resume and past experience, and the typical behavioral type questions ("tell me about a time when...").
The system design interview was probably the most challenging aspect of the process. LinkedIn is a web-scale company after all, so you need to have at least some basic familiarity with building distributed systems and making architectural design trade-offs in that context. Of all the components of the on-site interview, I would recommend spending more time preparing well for this one.
I definitely came away with a very positive impression of LinkedIn. All the interviewers I met were very friendly and smart, and all of them talked about how they loved the highly collaborative culture at LinkedIn. Definitely give these folks a shot if you have the opportunity.

Can't disclose due to NDA. But as mentioned above, LinkedIn appears to have a shared company-wide repository of coding questions. So if you look around on this and other sites, you'll probably see most of their coding questions in advance. But it seems they're really much more interested in your communication and design thinking skills anyway, not just whether you "solve" a problem.

I did a technical phone screen (yes, as all have said, the questions are all from here - just prepare Software Engineer, Senior Engineer and Principal Engineer questions and you will be completely covered). Every coding round has two questions - one easy and one difficult. You will need to answer both of them to move forward. The phone screen was done (Solved both the questions in less than 30 mins) and I was invited onsite. The onsite begins with a tour of the office which is nice. The recruiting coordinator was friendly and nice.
They gave me a loaner iPad with my schedule for the day. They also gave me a goody bag with a couple snacks and my LinkedIn connection map which was a nice personal touch. I then met with the recruiter for about 15 minutes - general casual talk about my job search. The first round is a host manager round. They question you on each of your prior experiences and ask you why you left that job, what kind of work you did there, how big a team, what was your contribution and so on. The second round is a coding round - two engineers and two questions (all questions are documented in Glassdoor multiple times from others so wont repeat it here). Third is technical communication and you have to explain your project in depth to an engineer - the engineer asks some questions on your decisions so please be ready to explain them. The next was the lunch interview - non technical and casual talk but the interviewer provides feedback on you. Next is a system design round (Again question is already on Glassdoor and is repeated many times - prepare variations of sliding time window system design for big data systems, and you will be able to answer questions here). Next was the final coding round - again two questions. Again just repetitive questions - nothing fancy. One of the final interviewers (he was a Senior SDE) did not know the answer to the question he posed. My code is an exact implementation from CLRS' algorithm book that I had prepared by reading up the question on Glassdoor. He did not get it/even look interested in getting it. His head was buried into his laptop and he could not be bothered into listening to me. He had a co-interviewer who wanted to talk/participate but this guy kept cutting him off - so unprofessional. Until this round, I had no negative impressions on LinkedIn and thought it might be a great place to work but this one guy started making me have my doubts on the quality of engineers there (again, there are bad employees everywhere - even in my current workplace - so it is probably just my frustration).
On the offer, I did not get one. Overall, I had four good rounds and one bad round. Two things for LinkedIn to note:
a. Please provide answers to the interview questions to your interviewers in addition to the questions from the question bank, so they know the answers to at least the questions they are asking and not waste people's time.
b. When I am asked to provide interview feedback on the loaner iPad at the end of the interview, please ask interviewers to step outside.
A shout out to the recruiter/sourcer and coordinator - Extremely professional and organized.
The recruiter also gave me feedback on my interview performance on their own accord that the only negative feedback was the last coding round. The rest supposedly went well and it was a narrow miss. So one bad round could impact you a big deal..

Interview

I interviewed with LinkedIn for a software engineering position in April. My interview experience was mixed; some of the interviewers came across as knowledgeable and articulate, while others were one or the other. There were times when the interviewer's poor communication skills hindered my ability to have a meaningful discussion with them. Overall, the interview process at LinkedIn left me with mixed feelings due to a lack of consistency in the quality of the interviewers. I hope they fix this, because it seems like a great place to work.

Interview

1 round design; 2 rounds algo + data structure; 1 round tech communication; 1 round HM
Tech questions were something very common. I killed them quickly. The HM gave me a very high level question like how to backup between two servers. no assumption was given. no guidance. I had no idea what he wanted, and he just kept smiling. I'd already known what would happen at that moment. Bad experience. Advice: try to avoid those kind of HMs who plan to hire their relatives. Comparing to FB, the interview culture here is very different.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in October 2015.

Interview

I interviewed to many top companies in Silicon Valley, but I must say LinkedIn gave the best interview experience to me.
Process went as follows:
- Recruiter contacted me via LinkedIn to see if I was interested in working for LinkedIn
- I interviewed for Mobile Software Engineer (Android)
1st Phone Screen:
A Coding exercise on Collabedit. Very friendly interviewer.
Things worked out fine, so they decided to move forward for an onsite with me. They booked nice hotel and rental car. My recruiter called in the morning to check on me and give last minute inspiration talks. I arrived at their office and checked in at the reception. My recruiter came and gave me a campus tour. Campus gave a good positive feeling. Then I was brought to an interview room that was reserved for me. On the White board they had written "Welcome 'In' *my_name*! You got this". There was a nice goodie bag kept for refreshments that I might need the whole day.
1st round: Android coding challenge on my laptop
2nd round: Design question
3rd round: Technical OOP/ Datastructures
Lunch.
4th round: Interview with hiring manager
5th round: Technical OOP/ Datastructure/Android
6th round: Design
After my last interview my interviewer dropped me till my car. My recruiter called me again to check on me.

It contains introduction, resume discussion followed by two technical coding algorithms/data structures questions. After 4 days I heard back from them and they want to setup second interview round. It is the same like previous one with two interviewers only and same type of coding questions. After all, I had to wait for a long time as they took a long time to give me an offer after final interview. I got offer after 1 month of second/final interview.

2 Phone Screens and a coding test. The first phone screen was general and did not discuss technology. The second phone screen asked basic CS questions like the difference between a heap and a binary tree and about certain common design patterns often used by Java Programmers.
Then there was a fairly difficult programming test, that the person who provided it seemed to imply must be completed in Java but it turns out choice of language doesn't really matter. I wish I had known that, it would have been much easier to complete it in a higher level language and one I was more familiar with.

Interview

LinkedIn recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn :)
Phone interview was scheduled for the following week. Recruiter sent me LinkedIn profiles of interviewer. As mentioned my multiple other candidates, they usually have 2 person on the telephonic interview. 2nd person is usually shadowing the main interviewer.
I received a phone call at the scheduled time and was given an algorithmic problem. I started discussing my approach and had a working solution with good complexity. The interview kept pushing me towards his solution even though it was not an improvement on my solution in terms of complexity. I did not push enough to keep my solution and tried to implement the approach suggested by interviewer. There wasn't enough time to complete the solution and I was stuck in between since I did not understand clearly the direction he wanted me to go.
This was pretty bad, that interviewer was so adamant around directing me towards his solution. He was pretty rude as well and did not take time to understand my solution at all. I have interviewed with LinkedIn before (during my graduation) and was really bad experience there as well. The last time I even heard the other interviewer laughing as I was writing my solution.
LinkedIn, you are a great engineering company and I really like some of the open source projects you have, but I would never want to work with arrogant and rude people on team. I hope this gets communicated back to interview panel.

I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA) in September 2015.

Interview

I am an experienced engineer. I was contacted on LI by a LI recruiter, for a LI job. Pretty funny. Anyway, the phone interview was pretty easy. First question was a popular question I have seen before, which I coded up quick. The second one was a new question. I solved it using recursion, and finally realized that I could use DP to make it more efficient. Refactored it using DP, and the interviewer was very happy. I was invited to the onsite a couple of days later.
Onsite was 5 modules. 2 modules were coding/algorithms, which were more in-depth than the phone interview. Coding and algorithms is my strength though, and I did very well on those. The next module was system design. I was really lucky to get an easier design problem (I'm not good at these stupid system design questions). I think I did alright. The next one was a communication module, where I talked about my favorite project from my resume. The last was a host manager module, where we chatted with each other and got a better understanding of myself and the position/company.
Overall it was a very pleasant experience. I got an offer a couple of weeks later (which was pretty good), but I declined because I had another offer from Google.
It is basically a standard algos+coding, design, and resume/behavioral interview. I think LI did a good job hitting all those vectors. I was happy with what I saw (engineers looked happy, everyone was upbeat). I can see myself working here if I didn't have the Google offer.

I applied through an employee referral. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at LinkedIn (Sunnyvale, CA) in November 2015.

Interview

Referred by a friend and got contacted by a recruiter in Data & Infrastructure field. I am not quite sure whether this position is the best fit for me but I took the phone screen one week later. I answered two quick questions (semaphore vs mutex, write-back vs write-through) and two coding questions. Even though I aced all of them, I felt like I am not in a strong position in infrastructure track. One week later recruiter invited me for onsite interview and kindly agreed to switch me to application track. The onsite was amazing and had lots of fun. Recruiters seemed to let you impressed with great food and working environment there. Four rounds in total, two algorithm, one system design and one manager. I found lots of details were asked in algorithm rounds: you are supposed to prove assumptions mathematically and make sure you got everything correct at each step. It was not like coding up the answers correctly was the final expectation, but rather the way you tackle them. For system design question, make sure you did some research on internet to find how to prepare that (Quora, HireTech). If you are familiar with web server, load balance, master-slave db, data sharding, caching, denormalizing, etc.. you are in good shape. Got offer two weeks later. It is a late offer because recruiter was not so quick to reply emails and didn't respect my deadlines. I have signed on Google and need to reject it. But overall, great company and great interview process.

Given that there are two interviewers, it was a mistake that the inexperienced one was in charge because he then started to ask me to find a suboptimal solution. Seriously? I'm then asking him stuff like "Did you have a running time in mind for the suboptimal way?"

I applied through a recruiter. I interviewed at LinkedIn.

Interview

My experience echoes the review in Nov 2015. It is pretty bizarre. The interviewers are pretty set in their solution, and not interested in your solution, even though I tried to explain why it is practically better. It does not reflect very well on LinkedIn as an innovative engineering organization: you disregard an opinion just because it is different.
Some example: They insisted on linked-list based implementation for stack, argued that array-based one is not optimal during inserts. I already acknowledged it is O(1) armortized and tried to convince it is in practice (hint: javadoc of ArrayDeque). I had to explain to the interviewers removing items from the end of an ArrayList is O(1), not O(N) like random removal. I had to change my generic variable E to T because interviewers think it is wrong (it does not matter, and E is actually the convention for collections). And it goes on.
